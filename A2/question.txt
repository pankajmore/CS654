In this assignment you have to design an architecture for fail over
mechanism of VM and Implement it using any VM package like virtual box,
vmware, lxc, xen, openvz.

Consider the following scenario

There is a process running on a VM which do counting and writes to a file
in your home folder(user@csews12:/users/mtech/<user>/<filename>)

There are various possibilities in which process can fail, for example
VM fails, Process stops etc.

You have to submit a document describing
1. What are the possible ways in which system may fail.
2. How will you detect if there is failure.
3. How will you recover the system.

Write code for detecting failure and recovering the same.

The document and the code - both are important.
